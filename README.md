## Boris Bikes

Transport for London, the body responsible for delivery of a new bike system, come to you with a plan: a network of docking stations and bikes that anyone can use. They want you to build a program that will emulate all the docking stations, bikes, and infrastructure (repair staff, and so on) required to make their dream a reality.

The aim for this project is to familiarise myself with creating a project and gain exposure to debugging and test driven development (TDD).
